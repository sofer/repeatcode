*Some courses* can make use of the text-to-voice capabilities of modern computers.

Before enabling text-to-voice, you will need to install (and pay for) the relevant foreign language voices from "Acapela":http://www.acapela-group.com/ or other vendors. 

You will also need to use the "Firefox":www.mozilla.com/firefox/ web browser and the  "Outfox":http://code.google.com/p/outfox/wiki/GettingStarted Add-on for Firefox. Outfox is still experimental and has not yet been tested by the Firefox editorial team. So, proceed with caution.

If you are not sure about any of this, keep _Text to voice_ unchecked when editing your <%= link_to 'account details', '/account' %>.
