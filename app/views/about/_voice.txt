*Some courses* can make use of the text-to-voice capabilities of modern computers.

Before enabling text-to-voice, you will need to install the relevant foreign language voices from "Acapela":http://www.acapela-group.com/. Trial versions are available for free download, but if you want to continue to use text-to-voice, you will need to pay Acapela's licence fee.

You will also need to use the "Firefox":www.mozilla.com/firefox/ web browser and the  "outfox":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8283/ Add-on for Firefox. Outfox is still experimental and has not yet been tested by the Firefox editorial team. So, proceed with caution.

If you are not sure about any of this, keep _Text to voice_ unchecked when editing your <%= link_to 'account details', '/account' %>.
